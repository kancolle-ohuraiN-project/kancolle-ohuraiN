Kantai collection unofficial offline version (using web resources and logic, not touching PSV version)
</p>

---

**English** | [简体中文](./README.md) | [projects view](https://github.com/orgs/offline-colle/projects/1)

**Because the English of the main developer is not very good (native language is Chinese), there may be translation / syntax errors in many places in this readme. Please forgive me!**

## What is this? 🤔

This project is an **open source offline version** made to prevent the Kantai collection from being unable to play due to the sudden **suspension of service**

>The opportunity is this post from Nga community: [有没有大佬考虑过关服以后，把舰C做成单机？](https://bbs.nga.cn/read.php?tid=22543276&_ff=-7202235 "click to jump to Nga")

This warehouse uses **unity2020 3.30f1c1** fabrication

All resource files are from the Kantai collection web page

## Can this be connected to the Internet? (is this a third-party server?) 🔗

The networking function will not be developed now, so all mechanisms are similar to PSV Version (that is, the web version runs offline)

(although similar steam creative workshops may be developed for players to add custom activities, etc.)

If the service is stopped one day, we may develop the exercise function of the supervisor (not yet)

(and because of the server cost, it may require donations to maintain)

##### In addition, it is emphasized that this is not a third-party server. All goods and resources in this project come from the liver. There is no money to make you strong. We will open the exercise function of the supervisor at most in the future, so this is not a third-party server!

## Will the project continue? 📑

It's hard to say for the following reasons:

1. Attack of DMM: we were ordered to shut down by DMM because we couldn't survive the Kantai collection and customs service
2. Abandonment of developers: if there is no more maintenance, the project may not go far
**3. Attack of "troll": I am very disgusted with some "troll". I think I am self righteous. I don't know what this is. I start to spray it as soon as I see what games / other resources are like (although this project is modeled on the Kantai Collection). You can talk about it, but please don't release words such as "this is the pirated Kantai collection" and "what qualifications do you have to imitate the Kantai collection", If you find it, delete the library immediately and do not cue**

## I want to participate in the production of this project ⚒️

We very much welcome you to participate in the production of this project, because we are not professionals, but amateurs from all professions who use love to generate electricity

If you want to participate in the production of this project, you can contact `@misaka10843`

Or directly PR your code, and we will merge the request after passing the test

## What about copyright disputes 😥
Copyright is actually the most important and biggest factor hindering the development of this project

Because according to DMM, it is not allowed to use any resources in the cache to make peers and so on

Therefore, we should not publicize too much, or if DMM knows about it, we can only delete the database or be written by a lawyer

But after all, it's made for love, so we will still make it under pressure (but it won't be developed full-time. After all, we still have to eat. WWW)

## Phase I development plan of the project 🗒️

* [x] login screen restore
* [x] load interface restore
* [x] home port interface restoration (no interactive function)
* [ ] compile interface restore
* [ ] resupply interface restore
* [ ] build interface restore
* [ ] refit interface restore
